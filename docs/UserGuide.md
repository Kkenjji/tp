TAssist is a **desktop application** for Teaching Assistants (TAs) from NUS School of Computing to easily track and manage student information. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI), complemented by a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAssist helps you complete student management tasks more quickly than traditional GUI-based apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to a folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TAssist.

4. Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)

5. Navigate to the folder where you saved the `[CS2103T-W12-4][TAssist].jar` file using `cd` command<br>
   Example (Windows): `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`. <br>
   Example (Mac/Linux): `cd /Users/YourName/Downloads`.

6. Type the following command and press Enter to run the application.<br>
    ```java -jar [CS2103T-W12-4][TAssist].jar```

7. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

8. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
    Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@u.nus.edu s/A0135246R` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the student list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Tips

1. If you are already familiar with TAssist, you can jump straight to our [Command Summary Table](#Command-summary) to view all available commands.

2. To access this User Guide quickly, simply press `F1` key at any time.

3. TAssist allows users to personalize the appearance of the application by switching between different color themes.<br>
   Users can press the `F2` key to cycle through the available themes. <br>
   Available themes: Dark, Bright, Pink

4. Viewing Upcoming Events Calendar: `F3`<br>
   TAssist provides a calendar-style view to help you visualize upcoming assignments and timed events. Events are grouped and displayed by their due dates, along with the list of students assigned to each.
    * Press the F3 key to open the calendar-style event viewer.
    * Display includes: Assignment names, Event type (e.g., assignment), Assigned students, Dates grouped chronologically
    * An empty calendar will be shown if there are no current Assignments.

5. Use student ID and index interchangeably.<br>
   Most commands support both student ID and list index. 
   For example:<br>
   `github 1 g/https://github.com/johndoe`<br>
   or <br>
   `github A1234567B g/https://github.com/johndoe`<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters with prefix (p/, c/ etc.) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Refer to [Parameters](#parameters) for more information.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing, Filtering and Sorting students : `list`

Shows a **list of all students** in the student list.

Format: `list [f/FILTER_TYPE fv/FILTER_VALUE] [s/SORT_TYPE o/SORT_ORDER]` <br>

* All parameters are optional. Filters and sorting can be used together or independently.
* **Note:** Once a sort is applied using the list command, the list will remain sorted in that order throughout the session.
  To apply a different sort, use list again with a new sort type and order.
  If a sort is applied on a field where multiple students share the same value, their positions may change randomly after add/edit/update operations due to tie-breaking by the system.

#### Filter Options
`FILTER_TYPE:`<br>
* progress: Filters students whose progress is less than or equal to the provided value.
* team: Filters by existing team names.
* class: Filters by existing class number.

`FILTER_VALUE:`<br>
* PROGRESS: An integer between 0 and 100.

* des â€” Descending (Z â†’ A or highest â†’ lowest).

Examples:
* `list`<br>
  Displays all students.
* `list f/progress fv/60` <br>
  Displays students with progress â‰¤ 60.
* `list s/github o/asc`<br>
  Displays all students, sorted by Github username in ascending lexicographical order.

### Saving the data

TAssist data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TAssist data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation:
**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAssist will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TAssist to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAssist home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. Users must provide inputs according to the parameters specified in the User Guide. If an invalid or unrecognized parameter is used, TAssist will treat it as an error related to the previous valid parameter.<br>
   For example: <br>
   `assignment n/quiz pr/30 d/22-11-2027`<br>
   `assignment n/quiz ab/xx d/22-11-2027`<br>
   Both examples will result in an error message related to the `name` parameter:<br>
   "Name should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank."<br>
   This is because pr/30 and ab/xx are not valid parameters for the assignment command.
